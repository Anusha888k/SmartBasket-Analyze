# SmartBasket-Analyze
3D Visualization of Customer Clustering and Product Association Patterns

Basket Analyzer Project

## Overview
This project synthetically creates customer transaction data. It also applies an Apriori algorithm for association rule mining and performs a K-means clustering on customer behavior. Visualization in 3D is made of the result.

## Running the Code
1. Install Python and dependencies: `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotly`, `scikit-learn`, `tqdm`, `faker`
2. Run the `analyzer.py` script to create the output visualizations.

```bash
python analyzer.py
